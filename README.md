# Chromatiles
A colourful new spin on tangram puzzles - a mobile puzzle game with colour mixing mechanics

# üé® Chromatiles

**A colourful new spin on an old classic**

Chromatiles takes the traditional tangram puzzle and revolutionizes it with innovative color-mixing mechanics. Players arrange translucent, colored tiles that can overlap to create new colors, solving both shape and color-matching challenges in this unique puzzle experience.
